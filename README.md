Daily Quiz: pinpoint the shown country (or area) on a world map without country borders!

This webpage is a personal project of mine to get a feel for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Feel free to suggest any additions and/or improvements to my code!
However, I aim to be the only editor of this project, as I try to use it as a way to improve my web development skills :)
